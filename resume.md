### 2nd Place - Stokes Hackathon 2014
- Keeping in contact is hard, but using apps is easy. Ties is an app that motivates you to keep in contact with the people you care about. You select individual contacts to track in the app and have a certain amount of time to get in contact with them before the app will delete the contact from your phone. Everytime you reach out to someone, their timer will reset. The app can set custom timers depending on how often you want to reach out to someone and will send notifications when one of your contacts is reaching their time limit. 

### 2nd Place - Berkeley Student Technology Council Web App Competition 2013
- StudyBuddy is a web app I created with a couple friends for Facebook's battle of the bay hackathon. It allows Berkeley students to easily create study groups for their classes. You simply select a class that you are interested in and create a study group or join an existing one. Then the app will create an email list for all of you to keep in touch through.
